import { Button } from '../components/button'

# Flows.sh demo


Here is where I test out the <a href="https://flows.sh" target='_blank'>Flows.sh</a> 


<button className="flow-1"> Flows are cool!</button>

<p className='flow-2'>but are they really?</p>

<button className="flow-3"> Yes</button>
<button className="flow-4"> No</button>
